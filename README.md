The correct results are not printed in the terminal (Pypoll)
The winner was hard coded 
In the assignment a few of the requirements were not successfully met: added script for calculating winner, added script for creating candidate list 

Create two outputs and save outputs to files:

PyBank: create a financial analysis that calculates the following items:

    Changes in profit/losses
    Average changes in the profit/losses
    Greatest increase in profits both dollar amount and month/date of occurence
    Greatest decrease in profits both dollar amount and month/date of occurrence

code sources:
*get profit from January in order to calculate previous profit for next months 
*calculate net total amount of profit/losses for the entire period created with tutor David Chao
*changes in profit/losses for entire period created with tutor David Chao
*print output f statement created with tutor David Chao
